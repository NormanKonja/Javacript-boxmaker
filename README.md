This code allows you to click and create boxes in on a blank html page and you may use this code to help make educational games or escape the room type of games of things of that sort, just layer it on top of my code and you can easily find dimensions of the boxes and areas they will take up!
The boxes can be dragged into different areas on your white screen.
